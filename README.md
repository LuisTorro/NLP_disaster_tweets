# NLP_disaster_tweets
This is a project for a kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started

The goal of the project is to predict whether a tweet is talking about a disaster or not using machine learning models:

In this competition, you’re challenged to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t. You’ll have access to a dataset of 10,000 tweets that were hand classified. If this is your first time working on an NLP problem, we've created a quick tutorial to get you up and running.
This dataset was created by the company figure-eight and originally shared on their ‘Data For Everyone’ website here.

This is a approach to the problem using Tfid-vectorizer and scikit-learn.
